# 3-Dimensional-Medical-Imaging-Preprocessing

The following repository contains pre-processing codes for 3D Medical Imaging data. 

In this provided tutorial, a public abdomen dataset is extracted from: Multi-Atlas Labeling Beyong the Cranial Vault Workshop and Challenge Link: https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn3193805/wiki/217789

In this notebook, the following is covered:
1. Reading Nifti Data and plotting
2. Different intensity normalization approaches
3. Resampling 3D CT data
4. Cropping and padding CT data
5. Histogram equalization
6. Maximum Intensity Projection (MIP) => recall, in scientific visualization, a "maximum intensity projection (MIP)" is a method for 3D data that projects in the visualization plane the voxels with maximum intensity that fall in the way of parallel rays traced from the viewpoint to the plane of projection.
